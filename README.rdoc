= Rack::GridFS

Rack:GridFS is a Rack middleware for creating HTTP endpoints for files
stored in MongoDB's GridFS.  You can configure a prefix string which
will be used to match the path of a request and supply an id for looking
up the file in the GridFS store.

For example,

  GET '/gridfs/someobjectid'
  
If the prefix is "gridfs", then the id will be be "someobjectid".

== Mongo Driver Compatibility Notes

This version is currently based off of mongo-0.20.1.  

As of mongo-0.19.1, there have been significant changes to GridFS.  I do
not plan to support versions of the mongo driver prior to 0.19.  There are
some compatibility issues with mongo-0.19 vs. mongo-0.20 (Mongo::ObjectId
vs. BSON::ObjectId).  For now, I am choosing to support mongo-0.20.

== Installation

  sudo gem install skinandbones-rack-gridfs --source=http://gems.github.com

  use Rack::GridFS, :hostname => 'localhost', :port => 27017, :database => 'test', :prefix => 'gridfs'

You must specify MongoDB database details:

  # TODO: THIS COULD USE A LOT MORE EXPLANATION!

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sinatra'

  require 'rack/gridfs'
  use Rack::GridFS, :hostname => 'localhost', :port => 27017, :database => 'test', :prefix => 'gridfs'
